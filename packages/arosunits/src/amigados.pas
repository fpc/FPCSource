 * The CSource data structure defines the input source for "ReadItem()"
 * as well as the ReadArgs call.  It is a publicly defined structure
 * which may be used by applications which use code that follows the
 * conventions defined for access.
 *
 * When passed to the dos.library functions, the value passed as
 * struct *CSource is defined as follows:
 *      if ( CSource == 0)      Use buffered IO "ReadChar()" as data source
 *      else                    Use CSource for input character stream
 *
 * The following two pseudo-code routines define how the CSource structure
 * is used:
 *
 * long CS_ReadChar( struct CSource *CSource )
 *
 *      if ( CSource == 0 )     return ReadChar();
 *      if ( CSource->CurChr >= CSource->Length )       return ENDSTREAMCHAR;
 *      return CSource->Buffer[ CSource->CurChr++ ];
 *
 *
 * BOOL CS_UnReadChar( struct CSource *CSource )
 *
 *      if ( CSource == 0 )     return UnReadChar();
 *      if ( CSource->CurChr <= 0 )     return FALSE;
 *      CSource->CurChr--;
 *      return TRUE;
 *
 *
 * To initialize a struct CSource, you set CSource->CS_Buffer to
 * a string which is used as the data source, and set CS_Length to
 * the number of characters in the string.  Normally CS_CurChr should
 * be initialized to ZERO, or left as it was from prior use as
 * a CSource.

 * character stream to parse, else the input comes from the buffered STDIN
 * calls ReadChar/UnReadChar.
 *
 * RDA_DAList is a private address which is used internally to track
 * allocations which are freed by FreeArgs().  This MUST be initialized
 * to NULL prior to the first call to ReadArgs().
 *
 * The RDA_Buffer and RDA_BufSiz fields allow the application to supply
 * a fixed-size buffer in which to store the parsed data.  This allows
 * the application to pre-allocate a buffer rather than requiring buffer
 * space to be allocated.  If either RDA_Buffer or RDA_BufSiz is NULL,
 * the application has not supplied a buffer.
 *
 * RDA_ExtHelp is a text string which will be displayed instead of the
