The fpexprpars unit contains an expression parser.
The parser compiles the expression into a node tree, which is 
type checked after it was compiled.

The expression parser handles the following types:
  String 
  Integer (64-bit)
  Float (TExprFloat, normally Double) 
  TDateTime
  Boolean 

The following operations are allowed:
  + - / * 
  not and or xor
  ( ) 
The binary operations can also be done on integer values, in which
case they act on the bits of the integer.

In the case of strings addition results in concatenation of the strings.

Operator precedence is observed. In case of equal precedence, evaluation
order is left-to-right.

Normally, both operands of binary operations must have the same type.
There are 2 exceptions: The engine will convert integers to float or
TDateTime if it detects that one of the nodes is a float or datetime.

The engine can be extended with variables and functions. There are over
60 built-in functions, which can be enabled by setting the Builtins property
of the expression parser to a set of the following values:

 bcStrings: Various string routines
    length copy delete pos lowercase uppercase stringreplace comparetext

 bcDateTime: Various datetime routines
    date time now dayofweek extractyear extractmonth extractday extracthour
    extractmin extractsec extractmsec encodedate encodetime encodedatetime
    shortdayname shortmonthname longdayname longmonthname formatdatetime   

 bcMath: Various mathematical routines
    pi cos sin arctan abs sqr sqrt exp ln log frac int round trunc

 bcBoolean: Various boolean routines
    shl shr IFS IFF IFD IFI  

 bcConversion : Conversion routines
   inttostr strtoint strtointdef floattostr strtofloat strtofloatdef
   booltostr strtobool strtobooldef datetostr timetostr strtodate strtodatedef
   strtotime strtotimedef strtodatetime strtodatetimedef 

Additional functions/variables can be added to the Identifiers collection:

  FP : TFPexpressionParser;

The following will define a TODAY variable which has value equal to the date
at the moment is is defined:

  FP.Identifiers.AddDateTimeVariable('TODAY',Date);
  
The following will define a function echodate:

Procedure EchoDate(Var Result : TFPExpressionResult; Const Args : TExprParameterArray);

begin
  Result.resDateTime:=Args[0].resDateTime;
end;

  FP.Identifiers.AddFunction('EchoDate','D','D',@EchoDate);

The arguments are:
  Name : Name of the function
  Result type : Character with result type:
    I : integer
    S : String
    F : FLoat
    D : TDateTime
    B : Boolean
  Argument types : A string with each character the type of argument at that position.
  Callback : executed when the function is called. This can be a procedural
             variable or an event (procedure of object).

Result and arguments are type-checked.
  
The engine knows 2 built-in functions which are handled specially:

  IF(Expr,Res1,Res1)

Will return Res1 if expr evaluates to True, or Res2 if expr evaluates to False.
The types of Res1 and Res2 must be the same, and expr must be a boolean
expression.

  CASE(Tag,Def,Label1,Value1,Label2,Value2,...)

Case will examine the value of Tag and compare it with Label1, Label2 etc.
till a match is found. It will return Value1, Value2 etc. depending on the
match. If no match is found, Def will be returned. From this it follows that
1) The number of arguments is always even and is at least 4.
2) The types of Tag, label1, label2 must be the same;
3) The types of Def, Value1, Value2 must be the same;
