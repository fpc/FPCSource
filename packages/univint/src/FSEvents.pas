{
 *  
 *  
 *  Discussion:
 *    This header describes the FSEvents API.  This API provides a
 *    mechanism to notify clients about directories they ought to
 *    re-scan in order to keep their internal data structures
 *    up-to-date with respect to the true state of the file system.
 *    (For example, when files or directories are created, modified, or
 *    removed.) It sends these notifications "in bulk", possibly
 *    notifying the client of changes to several directories in a
 *    single callback. By using the API, clients can notice such
 *    changes quickly, without needing to resort to recursive
 *    polling/scanning of the file system. 
 *    
 *    Much like kqueues, the FSEvents API allows an application to find
 *    near-immediately when the contents of a particular directory has
 *    changed.  However, unlike kqueues, the FSEvents API allows the
 *    application to monitor the whole file system hierarchy rooted at
 *    a specified directory (and still get precise per-directory
 *    notifications) -- to do this with the kqueues API would require
 *    the client to monitor each directory individually. 
 *    
 *    Clients can register interest in a chunk of the filesystem
 *    hierarchy and will receive callbacks from their runloop whenever
 *    an event occurs that modifies the filesystem therein.  The
 *    callback will indicate the exact directory in which the event
 *    occurred, so the client only has to scan that directory for
 *    updated info, not all its children.  Clients can supply a
 *    "latency" parameter that tells how long to wait after an event
 *    occurs before forwarding it; this reduces the volume of events
 *    and reduces the chance that the client will see an "intermediate"
 *    state, like those that arise when doing a "safe save" of a file,
 *    creating a package, or downloading a file via Safari. 
 *    
 *    
 *    
 *    The lifecycle of an FSEventStream consists of these stages:
 *    
 *    
 *    1. FSEventStreamCreate() / FSEventStreamCreateRelativeToDevice()
 *    -> Creates an FSEventStream. 
 *    
 *    2. FSEventStreamScheduleWithRunLoop() -> Schedules an
 *    FSEventStream on a runloop, like CFRunLoopAddSource() does for a
 *    CFRunLoopSourceRef. 
 *    
 *    3. FSEventStreamStart() -> Starts receiving events and servicing
 *    them from the client's runloop(s) using the callback supplied by
 *    the client when the stream was created. If a value was supplied
 *    for the sinceWhen parameter then "historical" events will be sent
 *    via your callback first, then a HistoryDone event, then
 *    "contemporary" events will be sent on an ongoing basis (as though
 *    you had supplied kFSEventStreamEventIdSinceNow for sinceWhen).
 *    
 *    
 *    4. FSEventStreamStop()  -> Stops the stream, ensuring the
 *    client's callback will not be called again for this stream.   
 *    After stopping the stream, it can be restarted seamlessly via
 *    FSEventStreamStart() without missing any events. 
 *    
 *    5. FSEventStreamInvalidate() -> Invalidates the stream, like
 *    CFRunLoopSourceInvalidate() does for a CFRunLoopSourcRef.
 *    
 *    
 *    6. FSEventStreamRelease() -> Decrements the refcount on the
 *    stream (initially one and incremented via FSEventStreamRetain()).
 *     If the refcount reaches zero, the stream is deallocated.
 *    
 *    
 *    Once the event stream has been started, the following calls can
 *    be used: 
 *    
 *    FSEventStreamGetLatestEventId() -> Initially, this returns the
 *    sinceWhen value supplied when the stream was created; thereafter,
 *    it is updated with the highest-numbered event ID mentioned in the
 *    current batch of events just before invoking the client's
 *    callback. Clients can store this value persistently as long as
 *    they also store the UUID for the device (obtained via
 *    FSEventsCopyUUIDForDevice()).  Clients can then later supply this
 *    event ID as the sinceWhen parameter to
 *    FSEventStreamCreateRelativeToDevice(), as long as its UUID
 *    matches what you stored.  This works because the FSEvents service
 *    stores events in a persistent, per-volume database.  In this
 *    regard,the stream of event IDs acts like a global, system-wide
 *    clock, but bears no relation to any particular timebase. 
 *    
 *    FSEventStreamFlushAsync() -> Requests that the fseventsd daemon
 *    send any events it has already buffered (via the latency
 *    parameter to one of the FSEventStreamCreate...() functions). This
 *    occurs asynchronously; clients will not have received all the
 *    callbacks by the time this call returns to them. 
 *    
 *    FSEventStreamFlushSync() -> Requests that the fseventsd daemon
 *    send any events it has already buffered (via the latency
 *    parameter to one of the FSEventStreamCreate...() functions). Then
 *    runs the runloop in its private mode till all events that have
 *    occurred have been reported (via the clients callback).  This
 *    occurs synchronously; clients will have received all the
 *    callbacks by the time this call returns to them. 
 *    
 *    FSEventStreamGetDeviceBeingWatched() -> Gets the dev_t value
 *    supplied when the stream was created with
 *    FSEventStreamCreateRelativeToDevice(), otherwise 0. 
 *    
 *    FSEventStreamCopyPathsBeingWatched() -> Gets the paths supplied
 *    when the stream was created with one of the
 *    FSEventStreamCreate...() functions. 
 *    
 *    Calls that can be made without a stream: 
 *    
 *    FSEventsCopyUUIDForDevice() -> Gets a UUID that uniquely
 *    identifies the FSEvents database for that volume. If the database
 *    gets discarded then its replacement will have a different UUID so
 *    that clients will be able to detect this situation and avoid
 *    trying to use event IDs that they stored as the sinceWhen
 *    parameter to the FSEventStreamCreate...() functions. 
 *    
 *    FSEventsGetCurrentEventId() -> Gets the most recently generated
 *    event ID, system-wide (not just for one stream). 
 *    
 *    FSEventsGetLastEventIdForDeviceBeforeTime() -> Gets the last
 *    event ID for the given device that was returned before the given
 *    time.  This is conservative in the sense that if you then use the
 *    returned event ID as the sinceWhen parameter of
 *    FSEventStreamCreateRelativeToDevice() that you will not miss any
 *    events that happened since that time.  On the other hand, you
 *    might receive some (harmless) extra events. 
 *    
 *    FSEventsPurgeEventsForDeviceUpToEventId() -> Purges old events
 *    from the persistent per-volume database maintained by the
 *    service.  You can combine this with
 *    FSEventsGetLastEventIdForDeviceBeforeTime(). Can only be called
 *    by the root user.

   * be delivered after latency seconds have elapsed. This flag is
   * useful for apps that are interactive and want to react immediately
   * to changes but avoid getting swamped by notifications when changes
   * are occurringin rapid succession. If you do not specify this flag,
   * then when an event occurs after a period of no events, the latency
   * timer is started. Any events that occur during the next latency
   * seconds will be delivered as one group (including that first
   * event). The delivery of the group of events resets the latency

 *    parameters specified when the stream was created.
 *  
 *  Parameters:
 *    
 *    streamRef:
 *      The stream for which event(s) occurred.
 *    
 *    clientCallBackInfo:
 *      The info field that was supplied in the context when this
 *      stream was created.
 *    
 *    numEvents:
 *      The number of events being reported in this callback. Each of
 *      the arrays (eventPaths, eventFlags, eventIds) will have this
 *      many elements.
 *    
 *    eventPaths:
 *      An array of paths to the directories in which event(s)
 *      occurred. The type of this parameter depends on the flags
 *      passed to FSEventStreamCreate...(). If
 *      kFSEventStreamCreateFlagUseCFTypes was set, then this will be a
 *      CFArrayRef containing CFStringRef objects (per
 *      CFStringCreateWithFileSystemRepresentation()). Ownership
 *      follows the Get rule, and they will be released by the
 *      framework after your callback returns. If
 *      kFSEventStreamCreateFlagUseCFTypes was not set, then the
 *      framework will pass your callback a raw C array of raw C
 *      strings that will be deallocated by the framework after your
 *      callback returns. A path might be "/" if ether of these flags
 *      is set for the event: kFSEventStreamEventFlagUserDropped,
 *      kFSEventStreamEventFlagKernelDropped.
 *    
 *    eventFlags:
 *      An array of flag words corresponding to the paths in the
 *      eventPaths parameter. If no flags are set, then there was some
 *      change in the directory at the specific path supplied in this
 *      event. See FSEventStreamEventFlags.
 *    
 *    eventIds:
 *      An array of FSEventStreamEventIds corresponding to the paths in
 *      the eventPaths parameter. Each event ID comes from the most
 *      recent event being reported in the corresponding directory
 *      named in the eventPaths parameter.  Event IDs all come from a
 *      single global source.  They are guaranteed to always be
 *      increasing, usually in leaps and bounds, even across system
 *      reboots and moving drives from one machine to another.  Just
 *      before invoking your callback your stream is updated so that
 *      calling the accessor FSEventStreamGetLatestEventId() will
 *      return the largest of the values passed in the eventIds
 *      parameter; if you were to stop processing events from this
 *      stream after this callback and resume processing them later
 *      from a newly-created FSEventStream, this is the value you would
 *      pass for the sinceWhen parameter to the
 *      FSEventStreamCreate...() function.

{

 *  
 *  Discussion:
 *    Attempts to register with the FS Events service to receive events
 *    per the parameters in the stream. FSEventStreamStart() can only
 *    be called once the stream has been scheduled on at least one
 *    runloop, via FSEventStreamScheduleWithRunLoop(). Once started,
 *    the stream can be stopped via FSEventStreamStop().
 *  
 *  Parameters:
 *    
 *    streamRef:
 *      A valid stream.
 *  
 *  Result:
 *    True if it succeeds, otherwise False if it fails.  It ought to
 *    always succeed, but in the event it does not then your code
 *    should fall back to performing recursive scans of the directories
 *    of interest as appropriate.

 *  Discussion:
 *    Asks the FS Events service to flush out any events that have

 *    parameter that was supplied when the stream was created.  This
 *    flushing occurs asynchronously -- do not expect the events to
 *    have already been delivered by the time this call returns.
 *    FSEventStreamFlushAsync() can only be called after the stream has
 *    been started, via FSEventStreamStart().
 *  
 *  Parameters:
 *    
 *    streamRef:
 *      A valid stream.
 *  
 *  Result:
 *    The largest event id of any event ever queued for this stream,
 *    otherwise zero if no events have been queued for this stream.
