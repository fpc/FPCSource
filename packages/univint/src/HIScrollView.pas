{  which allows users to click in the page up/down regions of a scroll bar and have    }
{  the thumb/indicator jump directly to the clicked position, which alters the value   }

{  with NewControl, use the kControlScrollBarLiveProc.                                 }
{  2. Write an appropriate ControlActionProc and associate it with your scroll bar     }

{  appropriately when the live-tracking scroll bar is clicked.                         }

 *  
 *  Discussion:
 *    This event is sent by an HIScrollView to its scrollable view to
 *    request that the scrollable view update its current origin and
 *    redraw. Typically, a scrollable view scrolls its content either
 *    by setting its bounds origin with HIViewSetBoundsOrigin or by
 *    offsetting its drawing by the scroll origin. If the view embeds
 *    other views, it must use HIViewSetBoundsOrigin to allow the
 *    embedded views to scroll along with their containing view. A view
 *    that uses HIViewSetBoundsOrigin should call that API in response
 *    to this event; a view that offsets its drawing by the scroll
 *    origin should update its current origin in its own instance data
 *    in response to this event. A scrollable view should also use
 *    either HIViewScrollRect to scroll its content, or
 *    HIViewSetNeedsDisplay to cause itself to redraw using the new
 *    origin point. A scrollable view must implement this event in
 *    order to scroll properly inside an HIScrollView.

 *  HIScrollViewCreate()
 *  
 *  Discussion:
 *    Creates a scroll view. This view has 3 parts, essentially. It can
 *    have one or two scroll bars (horizontal/vertical), and a view to
 *    be scrolled. The view to be scrolled is merely added via
 *    HIViewAddSubview. The scroll view will automatically connect it
 *    up appropriately. By default, the HIScrollView will not
 *    automatically hide the scroll bars if the content fits within the
 *    scrollable view. Use the HIScrollViewSetScrollBarAutoHide API to
 *    enable that feature.

 *  
 *  Discussion:
 *    Allows you to programmatically change what portion of a scroll
 *    view's target you are seeing. For example, you can move to the
 *    beginning or end of a document. You can also page up, down, left
 *    and right. In general, you should not call this from embedded
 *    content (i.e. the scrollable view inside the scroll view). For
 *    those cases, you should instead position yourself appropriately
 *    and tell the scroll view you changed via the
 *    kEventScrollableInfoChanged carbon event. This routine merely is
 *    a programmatic way to scroll as one would by hand using the
 *    scroll bars.

{

 *  
 *  Discussion:

 *    already at the top of the scrollable content, it is not possible
 *    to navigate upward, so home and page up actions would not be
 *    possible. You might use this function to help you update the
