{
 *  Pasteboard Manager
 *  
 *  Discussion:
 *    Pasteboard Manager is the replacement of the Scrap and Drag
 *    flavor APIs. Like the Scrap Manager, it is a cross process data
 *    transport mechanism. Unlike the Drag Manager, it is not bound to
 *    particular high level user actions to initiate and resolve the
 *    data transport. This allows the Pasteboard Manager to be used as
 *    the data transport mechanism for copy and paste, drag and drop,
 *    services, as well as generic cross process communication.
 *    
 *    
 *    Like scraps, pasteboards are local references to global, cross
 *    process, resources. Although, where scraps exist forever,
 *    pasteboard are CFTypes and should be released at the end of their
 *    usefulness. Multiple pasteboard references in a single
 *    application may point to the same global pasteboard resource.
 *    Once the global pasteboard resource has been cleared, all
 *    pasteboard references to that global resource in the application
 *    share ownership allowing any of them to add data to the
 *    pasteboard. Of course, this is not a free for all. Once a flavor
 *    has been added it can not be overwritten by another local
 *    reference. Calling CFRelease() on any one of these references
 *    will implicitly call in promises, but only those made through the
 *    particular pasteboard reference being released. In this way,
 *    local pasteboard references in various components of the
 *    application can add data, make promises, keep those promises, and
 *    release their local pasteboard reference independently of the
 *    other components. 
 *    
 *    For long lived pasteboards, like the clipboard or find
 *    pasteboards, the suggested usage model is for a component to
 *    create a local reference to a pasteboard at the beginning of its
 *    life cycle, hold on to it, and release it at the end of its life
 *    cycle. As long as a pasteboard reference in any application still
 *    points to the global pasteboard resource, the global resource
 *    will not be released. When the final reference is released,
 *    promises will not be called in as the global pasteboard resource
 *    will be released. Only if you want to guarantee a global
 *    pasteboard resource continues to exist beyond the life of your
 *    application should you refrain from calling CFRelease(). In this
 *    case, be sure to call PasteboardResolvePromises() to make sure
 *    any promises are called in. This is not necessary for the
 *    clipboard and find pasteboards as they are retained by the system
 *    and never released. 
 *    
 *    Like the Drag Manager, the Pasteboard Manager allows the use of
 *    multiple items each with its own set of flavors. When using the
 *    clipboard or find pasteboards, it's traditionally been common to
 *    only use the first item, but now multiple items can be copied as
 *    is the case in the Finder. This also opens up the ability for
 *    services to act on multiple items. Another difference from both
 *    the Scrap and Drag Managers is the use of Uniform Type Identifier
 *    based flavor types rather than four character code OSTypes. These
 *    have several advantages. They allow compatibility with Cocoa's
 *    NSPasteboard, more accurately describe the data being
 *    transported, provide a type inheritance mechanism and allow
 *    namespacing with a reverse DNS scheme.

{
 *  Pasteboard File Promising
 *  
 *  Summary:
 *    With the FSSpec type being deprecated and removed for 64 bit it is necessary
 *    to introduce a replacement for kDragFlavorTypePromiseHFS. The replacement comes
 *    in the form of two new Uniform Type Identifiers specifically for use with the
 *    pasteboard and promised files. Like the old HFS promise mechanism, the new UTI
 *    based method still requires a multistage handshake between sender and receiver
 *    but the process is somewhat simplified.
 *    
 *    Order of operations on copy or drag
 *    
 *    1) The sender promises kPasteboardTypeFileURLPromise for a file yet to be created.
 *    2) The sender adds kPasteboardTypeFilePromiseContent containing the UTI describing
 *          the file's content.
 *    
 *    Order of operations on paste or drop
 *    
 *    3) The receiver asks for kPasteboardTypeFilePromiseContent to decide if it wants the file.
 *    4) The receiver sets the paste location with PasteboardSetPasteLocation.
 *    5) The receiver asks for kPasteboardTypeFileURLPromise.
 *    6) The sender's promise callback for kPasteboardTypeFileURLPromise is called.
 *    7) The sender uses PasteboardCopyPasteLocation to retrieve the paste location, creates the file
 *          and keeps its kPasteboardTypeFileURLPromise promise.
 *
 *    Automatic translation support has been added so clients operating in the modern
 *    kPasteboardTypeFileURLPromise and kPasteboardTypeFilePromiseContent world can continue
 *    to communicate properly with clients using the traditional kDragFlavorTypePromiseHFS and
 *    kDragPromisedFlavor model.

 *  Mac OS X threading:

 *  
 *  Parameters:
 *    
 *    inPasteboard:
 *      A local pasteboard reference.
 *    
 *    inItem:
 *      A pasteboard item identifier in which to add the data or
 *      promise. Pasteboard item identifiers are unique values created
 *      by the owning application when adding pasteboard item flavor
 *      information to a drag. Additional flavors may be added to an
 *      existing item by using the same item identifier value.
 *      Depending on the application, it might be easier to use
 *      internal memory addresses as item identifiers (as long as each
 *      item being added has a unique item reference number).
 *      Pasteboard item identifiers should only be interpreted by the
 *      owning application.
 *    
 *    inFlavorType:
 *      A Uniform Type Identifier based flavor type associated with the
 *      data. If multiple flavors are to be added to an item, the
 *      owning application should add them in order of preference or
 *      richness as determined by the owing application.  The ordering
 *      will be retained when viewed by the receiving application.
 *    
 *    inData:
 *      A CFDataRef reference which receives the flavor data. Passing
 *      kPasteboardPromisedData, or NULL, indicates the data is
 *      promised. This is useful if the data is expensive to generate.
 *      Making promises requires the sender to also implement a promise
 *      keeper which must be set before the promise is made.
 *    
 *    inFlags:
 *      A PasteboardFlavorFlags set of flags to attach to the data.
