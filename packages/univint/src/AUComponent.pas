    @header AUComponent
	
	@discussion
	This file defines the collection of API calls for an audio unit. An audio unit is a plugin 
	that can be loaded into an application's process and used to process or generate audio. An 
	audio unit is an AudioComponent type and so
	the AudioComponent APIs are used to find specific types of audio units, open and close them.
	
	Audio units use a general notion of description to specify an unique instance. The Type is the 
	general category of an audio unit. The SubType is an unique identifier specified by the 
	Manufacturer (provider) of the audio unit. The IDs that are used for Type are specified by 
	Apple, the Manufacturer ID should be specified by an unique identifier
	(as registered with apple). See AudioComponentDescription.
	
	Audio unit types are of the following (see below for more information)

		kAudioUnitType_Output					= 'auou',
		kAudioUnitType_MusicDevice				= 'aumu',
		kAudioUnitType_MusicEffect				= 'aumf',
		kAudioUnitType_FormatConverter			= 'aufc',	
		kAudioUnitType_Effect					= 'aufx',	
		kAudioUnitType_Mixer					= 'aumx',
		kAudioUnitType_Panner					= 'aupn',
		kAudioUnitType_OfflineEffect			= 'auol',
		kAudioUnitType_Generator				= 'augn',

	An audio unit's general operations are:
		Open an audio unit (AudioComponentInstanceNew)
		Configure it based on the context - AudioUnitSetProperty
		Initialise the audio unit (AudioUnitInitialize)
			- at this point the audio unit is in a state where it can render audio
		Render audio (AudioUnitRender)
		
	An important part of a render operation for an audio unit is to manipulate the various controls 
	that the unit provides to change the render effects; for instance to change the decay time of 
	a reverb, the cut off frequency of a filter, etc. These are called parameters, and 
	AudioUnitGetParameter and AudioUnitSetParameter are used to interact with these.
	
	If any reconfiguration of the audio unit is required, then:
		uninitialise (AudioUnitUninitialise)
		Configure it based on the context - AudioUnitSetProperty
		Initialise the audio unit (AudioUnitInitialize)

	Once the host is finished with an audio unit, it closes it:
		Dispose audio unit (AudioComponentInstanceDispose)
	
	Audio units can be used programmatically (for instance a mixers could be used to render audio 
	for a game, a generator to play audio files, etc), or they can be hosted in Digital 
	Audio Workstation (DAW) applications such as Logic, Garage Band. In the DAW case, it is common 
	for an audio unit to provide a custom view to allow the user to interact with what can be 
	complex DSP operations that the audio unit performs. The view is retrieved from an audio unit 
	through AudioUnitGetProperty and then the host instantiates it 
	(see <AudioUnit/AUCocoaUIView.h>)

{!
    @enum           Audio Unit Types
    @abstract		different types of audio units
	@discussion		Audio unit's are classified into different types, where those types perform 
					different roles and functions.
					There are some general categories of functionality that apply across different 
					types of audio units:
					(1) Real-time usage
						The audio unit will complete its operations in less time that is 
						represented by the render buffer. All audio units with the exception of 
						the OfflineEffect should meet this criteria
					(2) Real-time I/O
						Will request the same amount of audio input as it is being asked to 
						produce for output. Effects, Panners, Mixers and MusicDevices are required 
						to adhere to this restriction. FormatConverter's can with some constraints
						be used in this situation (for instance, sample rate conversion, float-int),
						but the host of the audio unit is responsible for insuring this.
					(3) UI versus Programmatic usage
						UI usage covers the case of using an audio unit in a Digital Audio 
						Workstation (DAW) with appropriate UI (for example a filter in Garage Band 
						or Logic). Effects, Panners, MusicDevices are all expected to be usable 
						within this context. 
						Programmatic usage is where an audio unit is used by a host app as part of
						a general signal processing chain.
						For instance, a mixer audio unit can be used to take several different 
						audio sources in a game and mix them together. Mixers, Output units are 
						for programmatic usage. FormatConverter and Generator types are generally
						programmatic audio units, but if they can be used in a UI situation, they 
						specify a custom view. The app can then use that to decide that, with 
						appropriate constraints, the audio unit could be presented in a DAW type 
						application. For instance, the AUConverter audio unit from apple can do 
						sample rate conversion, etc, but has not general utility for a user in a 
						DAW app. Apple's Varispeed or AUTimePitch audio units can be used to change
						the playback rate and pitch and so could be used to good affect by a user 
						in a DAW type environment, as well as just providing this general 
						functionality to any program.
					
	@constant		kAudioUnitType_Output
					An output unit can be used as the head of an AUGraph. Apple provides a number 
					of output units that interface directly with an audio device
					
	@constant		kAudioUnitType_MusicDevice
					Used to describe software musical instruments such as samplers and 
					synthesisers. They respond to MIDI and create notes, which are then controlled
					through parameters or MIDI control messages. See <AudioUnit/MusicDevice.h>
										
	@constant		kAudioUnitType_MusicEffect
					Is an effect that is also able to respond directly to MIDI control messages, 
					typically through the mapping of these MIDI messages to different parameters 
					of the effect's DSP algorithm.
					
	@constant		kAudioUnitType_FormatConverter
					A format converter is a general category for audio units that can change the 
					format (for instance, sample rate conversion) from an input to an output, as 
					well as other, non-I/O type manipulations (like a deferred render or varispeed 
					type of operation). As such, a format converter can ask for as much or as 
					little audio input to produce a given output. They are still expected to
					complete their rendering within the time represented by the output buffer. 
					For format converters that have some utility as an "audio effect or processor", 
					it is quite common to provide an offline version of this audio unit as well. 
					For instance, Apple ships a format converter (for use in a "real-time" like 
					situation) and an offline version (for processing audio files) of the Time 
					Pitch and Varispeed audio units.
					
	@constant		kAudioUnitType_Effect
					An audio unit that will process some x number of audio input samples to produce 
					x number of audio output samples. The common case for an effect is to have a 
					single input to a single output, though some effects take side-chain inputs as 
					well. Effects can be run in "offline" contexts (such as processing a file), but 
					they are expected to run in real-time. A delay unit or reverb is a good 
					example of this.
					
	@constant		kAudioUnitType_Mixer
					An audio unit that takes some number of inputs, mixing them to provide 1 or 
					more audio outputs. A stere mixer (mono and stereo inputs to produce one 
					stereo output) is an example of this.
					
	@constant		kAudioUnitType_Panner
					A panner is a specialised effect that will pan a single audio input to a single
					output. Panner units are required to support a collection of standardised 
					parameters that specify the panning coordinates (aside from whatever custom 
					parameters the panner may provide). A surround panner is an example of this
					
	@constant		kAudioUnitType_Generator
					A generator will have no audio input, but will just produce audio output. In 
					some ways it is similar to a MusicDevice, except that a generator provides no 
					MIDI input, or notion of "notes". A tone generator is a good example of this.
					
	@constant		kAudioUnitType_OfflineEffect
					An offline effect is used to process data from a file and is also used to 
					publish a capability that cannot be run in real-time. For instance, the process
					of normalisation requires seeing the entire audio input before the scalar to 
					apply in the normalisation process can be estimated. As such, offline effects 
					also have a notion of a priming stage that can be performed before the actual 
					rendering/processing phase is executed.

	@enum			AudioUnitRenderActionFlags
	@discussion		These flags can be set in a callback from an audio unit during an audio unit 
					render operation from either the RenderNotify Proc or the render input 
					callback.

	@constant		kAudioUnitRenderAction_PreRender
					Called on a render notification Proc - which is called either before or after 
					the render operation of the audio unit. If this flag is set, the proc is being 
					called before the render operation is performed.
					
	@constant		kAudioUnitRenderAction_PostRender
					Called on a render notification Proc - which is called either before or after 
					the render operation of the audio unit. If this flag is set, the proc is being 
					called after the render operation is completed.

	@constant		kAudioUnitRenderAction_OutputIsSilence
					This flag can be set in a render input callback (or in the audio unit's render 
					operation itself) and is used to indicate that the render buffer contains only 
					silence. It can then be used by the caller as a hint to whether the buffer 
					needs to be processed or not.
					
	@constant		kAudioOfflineUnitRenderAction_Preflight
					This is used with offline audio units (of type 'auol'). It is used when an 
					offline unit is being preflighted, which is performed prior to the actual 
					offline rendering actions are performed. It is used for those cases where the 
					offline process needs it (for example, with an offline unit that normalises an 
					audio file, it needs to see all of the audio data first before it can perform 
					its normalisation)
					
	@constant		kAudioOfflineUnitRenderAction_Render
					Once an offline unit has been successfully preflighted, it is then put into 
					its render mode. So this flag is set to indicate to the audio unit that it is 
					now in that state and that it should perform its processing on the input data.
					
	@constant		kAudioOfflineUnitRenderAction_Complete
					This flag is set when an offline unit has completed either its preflight or 
					performed render operations
					
	@constant		kAudioUnitRenderAction_PostRenderError
					If this flag is set on the post-render call an error was returned by the 
					AUs render operation. In this case, the error can be retrieved through the 
					lastRenderError property and the audio data in ioData handed to the post-render 
					notification will be invalid.
	@constant		kAudioUnitRenderAction_DoNotCheckRenderArgs
					If this flag is set, then checks that are done on the arguments provided to render 
					are not performed. This can be useful to use to save computation time in
					situations where you are sure you are providing the correct arguments
					and structures to the various render calls

					The audio unit is unable to be initialised
	@constant		kAudioUnitErr_TooManyFramesToProcess
					When an audio unit is initialised it has a value which specifies the max

					unit is asked to render more than this, this error is returned.
	@constant		kAudioUnitErr_InvalidFile
					If an audio unit uses external files as a data source, this error is returned 
					if a file is invalid (Apple's DLS synth returns this error)
	@constant		kAudioUnitErr_FormatNotSupported
					Returned if an input or output format is not supported
	@constant		kAudioUnitErr_Uninitialized
					Returned if an operation requires an audio unit to be initialised and it is 
					not.
	@constant		kAudioUnitErr_InvalidScope
					The specified scope is invalid
	@constant		kAudioUnitErr_PropertyNotWritable
					The property cannot be written
	@constant		kAudioUnitErr_CannotDoInCurrentContext
					Returned when an audio unit is in a state where it can't perform the requested 
					action now - but it could later. Its usually used to guard a render operation 
					when a reconfiguration of its internal state is being performed.
	@constant		kAudioUnitErr_InvalidPropertyValue
					The property is valid, but the value of the property being provided is not
	@constant		kAudioUnitErr_PropertyNotInUse
					Returned when a property is valid, but it hasn't been set to a valid value at 
					this time.	
	@constant		kAudioUnitErr_Initialized
					Indicates the operation cannot be performed because the audio unit is 
					initialized.
	@constant		kAudioUnitErr_InvalidOfflineRender
					Used to indicate that the offline render operation is invalid. For instance,
					when the audio unit needs to be pre-flighted, 
					but it hasn't been.
	@constant		kAudioUnitErr_Unauthorized
					Returned by either Open or Initialise, this error is used to indicate that the 
					audio unit is not authorised, that it cannot be used. A host can then present 
					a UI to notify the user the audio unit is not able to be used in its current 
					state.

					sample buffer offset is provided
					
					When scheduling a ramped parameter, the ramp is scheduled each audio unit 
					render for the duration of the ramp. Each schedule of the the new audio unit 
					render specifies the progress of the ramp.

	@discussion		an audio unit will render the amount of audio data described by

					ioData. The caller should provide audio time stamps where at least the sample 
					time is valid and it is incrementing sequentially from its previous call 
					(so, the next time stamp will be the current time stamp + inNumberFrames) 
					If the sample time is not incrementing sequentially, the audio unit will infer
					that there is some discontinuity with the timeline it is rendering for
	
					The caller must provide a valid ioData AudioBufferList that matches the 
					expected topology for the current audio format for the given bus. The buffer 
					list can be of two variants:
					(1) If the mData pointers are non-null then the audio unit will render its 
					output into those buffers. These buffers should be aligned to 16 byte 
					boundaries (which is normally what malloc will return).
					(2) If the mData pointers are null, then the audio unit can provide pointers 
					to its own buffers. In this case the audio unit is required to keep those

					The host should reset the audio unit before adding it back so that it doesn't 
					produce audio from its delay lines that is no longer valid.

					resources (this is done in the Initialize calls).
