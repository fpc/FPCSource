Readme for libgmp.tar.bz2 2009-09-06

= What

  Free Pascal interface for the GNU Multiple Precision Arithmetic Library.

= Why

  Numeric computing outside the built in types range. AFAIK there is no complete
  binding for Free Pascal available yet.

= Files

  - gmp_accept_test.pas
    "Go/no go" test of the gmp unit against the GMP library on your system.

  - gmp.pas
    The interface unit.

  - gmp_testcase.pas
    Put this unit in your uses clause of a fpcunit project.

  - gmp_test_impl.inc
  - gmp_test_intf.inc
    Test classes declarations and implementations. Included by:
    * gmp_accept_test.pas
    * gmp_testcase

  - pidigits_example.pas
    Original source from:
    shootout.alioth.debian.org/u64/benchmark.php?test=pidigits&lang=fpascal&id=2
    Adapted for using the gmp unit.

  - pidigits_example2.pas
    Modified pidigits_example.pas to demonstrate usage of the gmp extensions.

  - printf_example.pas
    Demo using the GMP printf

  - printf_example2.pas
    Dtto with gmp extensions.

  - scanf_example.pas
    Demo using the GMP scanf.

  - scanf_example2.pas
    Dtto with gmp extensions.

= Status
  - Tested on 64 and 32 bit Linux and on 32 bit Windows.
  - Known issues
    * There is a link error on Windows with the GMP global variables.
      Probably could be solved with someone's better knowledge of the Windows
      environment.

= Bindings
  - Standard
    * Almost full (see comments in gmp.pas) binding of the types and functions
      exported from libgmp.

  - Extensions
    * Based on pseudo value types (in fact interface types) with an automatic
      memory management in the spirit of Object Pascal strings - compiler takes
      care of initialization/finalization. Copy on write semantics. Can intermix
      the standard binding/types with the extended ones. The extended types have
      access to a same set of numeric functions as in the standard binding.

  - Operators
    * Overloaded operators for the extensions value types. Can make programs
      significantly more readable/maintainable. See and compare for yourself
      in the pidigits examples. BTW, the overhead in this example with
      the extended types and operators is less than 10%. Unusable for shootout,
      but is probably acceptable in many other areas.

= Tips
  - range checks
    You should probably want to put asserts with *_fits before conversion to
    FPC ordinal types - applies to the assignment operator too.

= License
  - FPC developers, you can do anything you see appropriate with the sources.
    Review, refactor and/or reject :-)
