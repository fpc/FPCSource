0.99.15
 - dead key support under Windows and X11 (via XIM)
 - more character scripts (Latin 2, Latin 3, Latin 4, Latin 9, Katakana,
   Arabic, Greek with diacritics, Technical, Special, Publishing, APL, Hebrew,
   Thai, Currency signs - Korean Won sign and Euro sign) are now recognized and
   converted to Unicode in the X11 console. Previously only Latin 1, Greek
   without diacritics and Cyrillic were supported, but even they didn't work in
   recent ptcpas versions, due to regressions, which are now fixed as well.
 - use an alternative method (via GetKeyState) for obtaining the Alt, Shift and
   Control key modifier status under Windows; This eliminates a problem, where
   the alt key appears "stuck", after alt-tabbing away from the application,
   then focusing back to it with a mouse click.
 - new key modifiers added for distinguishing between left and right shift,
   control and alt, the status of num lock, caps lock and scroll lock and for
   distinguishing right keys (e.g. right shift, right alt, right ctrl),
   numpad keys and dead keys. All of them are implemented as elements in the
   ModifierKeys set, which was added to IPTCKeyEvent. They can be checked,
   for example, with:
     if pmkNumLockActive in key_event.ModifierKeys then
       ...
   The following modifiers are available:
     pmkAlt, pmkShift, pmkControl, pmkLeftAlt, pmkRightAlt, pmkLeftShift,
     pmkRightShift, pmkLeftControl, pmkRightControl, pmkNumLockActive,
     pmkNumLockPressed, pmkCapsLockActive, pmkCapsLockPressed,
     pmkScrollLockActive, pmkScrollLockPressed, pmkRightKey, pmkNumPadKey,
     pmkDeadKey
 - there is now a MoveMouseTo method, added to the console. It can be used to
   warp the mouse cursor to a different location.
 - added support for a relative mouse mode. It supports continuous mouse
   motion, not limited within the boundaries of the current window. It is
   usually used with an invisible cursor. It is activated with the
   'relative mouse on' console option, and turned off with the option
   'relative mouse off'.
 - the number of mouse buttons supported has been increased to 31. There is now
   support for a horizontal and a vertical mouse wheel, which are treated as
   buttons. Overall, this is the default button arrangement:
     PTCMouseButton1  - left mouse button
     PTCMouseButton2  - right mouse button
     PTCMouseButton3  - middle mouse button
     PTCMouseButton4  - mouse wheel rotated forward (scroll up)
     PTCMouseButton5  - mouse wheel rotated backward (scroll down)
     PTCMouseButton6  - mouse horizontal scroll wheel rotated left
     PTCMouseButton7  - mouse horizontal scroll wheel rotated right
     PTCMouseButton8  - "back" button ("X button 1")
     PTCMouseButton9  - "forward" button ("X button 2")
   The remaining mouse buttons are hardware specific and will vary, depending
   on the actual mouse (provided it has that many buttons at all).
 - ptccrt now supports several keyboard input modes, which can be set by
   changing the new global variable KeyMode. The following values are supported:
     kmTP7      - behaves like Turbo Pascal 7's CRT unit under DOS. This is the
                  default value. Previous versions of ptccrt always behaved this
                  way. Since TP7's CRT unit doesn't support the Enhanced
                  Keyboard, several keys (e.g. F11 and F12) and key combinations
                  are intentionally not recognized for compatibility reasons.
     kmGO32     - behaves like Free Pascal's CRT unit under DOS (GO32V2). It has
                  Enhanced Keyboard support.
     kmFPWINCRT - behaves like Free Pascal's CRT unit under Windows. Similar to
                  kmGO32, but emulates several incompatibilities that the
                  Windows CRT unit has with the GO32V2 CRT unit. Not all of them
                  are emulated though, since some of them can be considered
                  bugs.
 - ptcgraph now has a global string variable WindowTitle, which allows you to
   set the window title, before calling InitGraph
 - ptcgraph was extended to also support resolutions, different than the ones,
   defined by VESA. This means that you can now use ptcgraph with resolutions,
   higher than 1280x1024 and widescreen (e.g. 16:9 or 16:10) aspect ratios, as
   long as they are supported by the display. For this, you need to call
   QueryAdapterInfo and walk through the linked list of modes, to choose a
   mode, then pass its DriverNumber and ModeNumber to InitGraph. Here's an
   example:

uses
  ptcgraph, ptccrt;
var
  m: PModeInfo;
  gd, gm: Integer;
begin
  Writeln('List of all modes:');
  m := QueryAdapterInfo;
  while m <> nil do
  begin
    Writeln(m^.MaxX+1, ' x ', m^.MaxY+1, ' x ', m^.MaxColor);
    m := m^.next;
  end;

  Writeln('Now let''s find 1920x1080 with 16-bit colour...');
  m := QueryAdapterInfo;
  while m <> nil do
  begin
    if (m^.MaxX = (1920-1)) and (m^.MaxY = (1080-1)) and (m^.MaxColor = 65536) then
    begin
      InitGraph(m^.DriverNumber, m^.ModeNumber, '');
      SetColor($FFFF);
      OutTextXY(0, 0, 'Hurrah! Full HD 1920x1080 mode is available!');
      ReadKey;
      CloseGraph;
      Halt;
    end;
    m := m^.next;
  end;

  Writeln('Mode not found in list!');
end.

0.99.14.1
 - fixed X11 middle and right mouse button mapping. Previously, the right mouse
   button and the middle mouse button were swapped, compared to Windows and DOS
   and contrary to the documentation.

0.99.14
 - added new unit ptcmouse for use with ptcgraph & ptccrt applications. It is
   similar to the winmouse and msmouse units.
 - support for resizable windows extended. Your application now receives
   a new event IPTCResizeEvent and is allowed to call a new method called
   InternalResize, which adjusts the console's width and height according to
   the new window size. The previous behaviour where your application's image
   is scaled, without it realizing that the resolution is changed still works
   if you don't call InternalResize (or when you use ptcgraph for that matter)
 - added support for intercepting the windows close events. When using unit ptc
   directly, this is enabled by sending the option 'intercept window close' to
   the console and then handling the newly introduced IPTCCloseEvent event.
   When using ptcgraph and ptccrt, closing the window emulates pressing Ctrl-C,
   in other words, your application will receive the #3 key code via ReadKey.
 - fixed crash in hermes (the pixel conversion library, used internally by
   PTCPas), encountered when converting from indexed 8bpp to 32bpp on amd64,
   when the surface width is not multiple of 8
 - even more X11 keyboard fixes
 - removed the debug log (grlog.txt) written by programs that use ptcgraph

0.99.13
 - added support for OpenGL under X11 and Windows. You can now use PTCPas to
   initialize OpenGL and handle events for you in a multiplatform way (similar
   to GLUT or SDL). See ptcgl.pp and ptcgl2.pp in the example directory.
 - X11 keyboard handling improvements:
   - added support for the numpad keys
   - typematic repeat (i.e. when you press a key and hold it down) now sends
     only repeating key press events, instead of repeating pairs of key
     release + key press. This makes it possible to detect auto-repeat and is
     also the way that Windows behaves.

0.99.12
 - pressing Alt or F10 under Windows no longer pauses the application.
 - API changes:
    - PTC classes have been made descendants of TInterfacedObject and are now
      accessed via interfaces. This simplifies memory management, because
      objects are now reference counted and automatically freed when they are
      no longer used. Unfortunately, this breaks existing code. However it's
      relatively easy to fix. See the files INTF-CHANGES-0.99.12.txt and
      INTF-CHANGES-FAQ-0.99.12.txt for details.

0.99.11
 - added ptcgraph - an implementation of FPC's BGI-compatible graph unit on top
   of PTCPas. It should work on all platforms, supported by PTCPas,  except for
   DOS (because it doesn't have threads)
 - VBE console improvements:
    - support for double buffering with video page flipping
    - console update synchronized with the vertical retrace
    - automatic fallback to windowed mode, if initializing LFB fails. This
      results in better compatibility with NTVDM and other environments that
      would otherwise require adding the 'disable lfb' option to ptcpas.cfg.
    - support VBE 3+ separate LFB and Windowed color masks for direct color
      modes. This might fix some wrong color bugs in LFB mode on some modern
      VBE 3+ video cards.
 - fixed a bug in the X11 event handling that caused unnecessary high CPU use
   while waiting for an event

0.99.10
 - fpc 2.4.0 support
 - Win64 DirectX support
 - X11 DGA 2.0 support
 - VBE 2+ LFB support. Enabled by default. Offers a great performance
   improvement, but may fail on buggy VGA BIOSes or buggy DOS virtual
   machines. If it causes problems, it can be disabled by adding
   'disable lfb' to ptcpas.cfg.
 - API changes:
    - in the hermes unit, THermesHandle was replaced with
      THermesConverterHandle, THermesClearerHandle and THermesPaletteHandle,
      which should be treated as opaque pointers, not integers. This only
      matters if you use unit hermes directly, and not ptc.
 - various bugfixes and code cleanup.

0.99.9
 - big endian support.
 - Win64 support (GDI only. DirectX not supported yet).

0.99.8
 - added support for Windows CE. Still in alpha stage. Tested on a Motorola
   MPx220 smartphone.
 - added support for fullscreen X11 using the Xrandr extension (previously
   only the XF86VidMode extension was supported). Also fullscreen X11 now works
   even when there aren't any mode switching X11 extensions available. A single
   fullscreen mode, which has the size of the entire desktop is offered in this
   case.
 - added a new simple windowed win32 GDI console, which is able to run even
   without any version of DirectX installed.
 - the X11 console now returns a mode list.
 - fixed a bug which caused win32 fixed-size windows to be non-minimizable.
 - imported the OpenPTC 1.0.1 DOS VGA fakemode assembly routines - should give
   a nice speed boost on ancient 386/486/Pentium machines.

0.99.7
 - A new event system + mouse support. Yes, I know I should have done this
   earlier :) Fullscreen X11 with mouse still does not work well, I'm planning
   to fix this in the next version.
 - API changes:
    - TPTCKey class renamed to TPTCKeyEvent
    - Removed int32, short16 and char8 types.
      Replaced with: Uint64, Uint32, Uint16, Uint8,
                     Sint64, Sint32, Sint16, Sint8.
 - fixed fullscreen palette modes under DirectX (was buggy on modern NVIDIA and
   ATI video cards).
 - a new example program, demonstrating the mouse support.
   Use it as a reference for now, until I update the documentation with the new
   event handling stuff (hopefully this will happen in the next release).
 - X11 window is not resizable anymore. Maybe some day I'll implement (optional)
   stretching as in win32 windowed mode.
 - code cleanup. Hid some implementation details from the interface part.

0.99.6
 - Now distributed under the terms of the modified LGPL (used by the FPC RTL).
   See the file modified_lgpl.txt distributed with the library for details.
   Thanks to Glenn Fiedler (the author of the original OpenPTC C++ code, that
   this library is based on) and Christian Nentwich (the author of the original
   C code of the Hermes library and the X11 version of OpenPTC) for giving
   permission to distribute the code under this license.
 - The Free Pascal Development Team intends to distribute this library with the
   Free Pascal Compiler and to base the graph unit on it, which is very cool! :)
 - fullscreen support in xshm/ximage mode.
 - dga support is now disabled by default.
 - added workaround for the 'shmat' bug in fpc 2.0.0's rtl on amd64 linux.
 - fixed some compilation-related problems with the example programs.
 - fpc 2.0.2 - go32v2 compilation fixed. fpc 1.0.10 support dropped completely.
 - some other DOS code fixes and cleanups.
 - config file name changed to ptcpas.cfg (~/.ptcpas.conf on *NIX)

0.99.5
 - support for fpc 2.0.0. fpc 1.0.10 support dropped, except for DOS.
 - support for amd64 (the code is now 64-bit safe, but still little endian-only)
 - fix the (sometimes) missing titlebar when using the metacity window manager

0.99.4
 - some X11 fixes (missing cdecl's, wrong alignments, etc.)
 - FreeBSD and NetBSD now compile and work (dga and XShm still not tested...)
 - improved exception handling in demos and examples

0.99.3
 - support for fpc 1.9.2+ (adapted to use the new unix rtl)
 - the dos console uses rdtsc if available for more accurate timing
 - some vesa fixes

0.99.2
 - alt, shift, ctrl modifier keys support for X11
 - key release support for win32 and X11
 - new example (keybrd2) demonstrating the use of key release events

0.99.1
 - first release to sourceforge
