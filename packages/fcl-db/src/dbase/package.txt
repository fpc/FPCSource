Help on packages:

TDbf_<< (D)elphi | (C)++Builder | (K)ylix | (L)azarus >> << Version >> << (D)esign | <R>untime >>

eg:

TDbf_c5d    = C++ Builder 5 design time package
TDbf_d6r    = Delphi 6 runtime package
TDbf_l      = Lazarus design/runtime package

NOTE: Version 4 and earlier don't have designtime/runtime separated packages
