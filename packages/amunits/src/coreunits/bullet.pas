 *    changes the typeface to an undefined value, providing the List
 *    completes the typeface selection to the new typeface.  OTagPath
 *    is the null terminated full file path of the .otag file associated

 *    for rendering body text.  Display kern pairs are generally
 *    tighter values for display (e.g. headline) purposes.  The
