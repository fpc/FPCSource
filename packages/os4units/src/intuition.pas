{ New for V39, Intuition supports the IESUBCLASS_NEWTABLET subclass of the IECLASS_NEWPOINTERPOS event.
  The ie_EventAddress of such an event points to a TabletData structure (see below).

  The TabletData structure contains certain elements including a taglist. The taglist can be used for special tablet parameters.  A tablet driver
  should include only those tag-items the tablet supports.  An application can listen for any tag-items that interest it.  Note: an application
  must set the WA_TabletMessages attribute to TRUE to receive this extended information in its IntuiMessages.

  The definitions given here MUST be followed.  Pay careful attention to normalization and the interpretation of signs.

  Note: a stylus that supports tilt should use the TABLETA_AngleX and TABLETA_AngleY attributes.  Tilting the stylus so the tip
  points towards increasing or decreasing X is actually a rotation around the Y-axis.  Thus, if the stylus tip points towards
  positive X, then that tilt is represented as a negative TABLETA_AngleY.  Likewise, if the stylus tip points towards positive Y, that tilt is represented by positive TABLETA_AngleX.}

 TABLETA_AngleX      = TABLETA_Dummy + $03; // the angle of rotation or tilt about the X-axis.  This number should be normalized to fill a signed long LongInt.  Positive values imply a clockwise rotation about the X-axis when viewing from +X towards the origin.
 TABLETA_AngleY      = TABLETA_Dummy + $04; // the angle of rotation or tilt about the Y-axis.  This number should be normalized to fill a signed long LongInt.  Positive values imply a clockwise rotation about the Y-axis when viewing from +Y towards the origin.
