  Object Pascal Translation of bfd.h,
  used in the Binary File Descriptor library
  found in the GNU Binutils

  This translation itself is in the public domain, but don't ignore
  the copyright of the BFD lib itself (see 'original comments' below)

  History:
  07.08.2001: utessel@gmx.de (UT) (started translation)
    - the structs, defines and functions are separated to different
      blocks to have one large type block (since type forwards are not
      possible across different type blocks)
    - Maybe some comments were removed or are at wrong places: while
      the codelines were sorted I did not check everything
    - I did a lot of Search and Replace, so don't wonder if comments
      were changed a bit, too.
    - I renamed bfd to TBFD and a few other minor changes to keep the
      namespace a bit cleaner

(* bfd.h -- The only header file required by users of the bfd library

The bfd.h file is generated from bfd-in.h and various .c files; if you
change it, your changes will probably be lost.

All the prototypes and definitions following the comment "THE FOLLOWING
IS EXTRACTED FROM THE SOURCE" are extracted from the source files for
BFD.  If you change it, someone oneday will extract it from the source
again, and your changes will be lost.  To save yourself from this bind,
change the definitions in the source in the bfd directory.  Type "make
docs" and then "make headers" in that directory, and magically this file
will change to reflect your changes.

If you don't have the tools to perform the extraction, then you are
safe from someone on your system trampling over your header files.
You should still maintain the equivalence between the source and this
file though; every change you make to the .c file should be reflected
here.  *)

  that are not used, so that the code for those functions need not be
  included in the output.

  VTABLE_INHERIT is a zero-space relocation used to describe to the
  linker the inheritence tree of a C++ virtual function table.  The
  relocation's symbol should be the parent class' vtable, and the
  relocation should be located at the child vtable.

  VTABLE_ENTRY is a zero-space relocation that describes the use of a
  virtual function table entry.  The reloc's symbol should refer to the
  table of the class mentioned in the code.  Off of that base, an offset
  describes the entry that is being used.  For Rela hosts, this offset
  is stored in the reloc's addend.  For Rel hosts, we are forced to put
  this offset in the reloc's section offset. *)
