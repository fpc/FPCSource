    { the PlanePick and PlaneOnOff variables work much the same way as the
     * equivalent GELS Bob variables.  It's a space-saving
     * mechanism for image data.  Rather than defining the image data
     * for every plane of the RastPort, you need define data only
     * for the planes that are not entirely zero or one.  As you
     * define your Imagery, you will often find that most of the planes
     * ARE just as color selectors.  For instance, if you're designing
     * a two-color Gadget to use colors two and three, and the Gadget
     * will reside in a five-plane display, bit plane zero of your
     * imagery would be all ones, bit plane one would have data that
     * describes the imagery, and bit planes two through four would be
     * all zeroes.  Using these flags allows you to avoid wasting all
     * that memory in this way:  first, you specify which planes you
     * want your data to appear in using the PlanePick variable.  For
     * each bit set in the variable, the next "plane" of your image
     * data is blitted to the display.  For each bit clear in this
     * variable, the corresponding bit in PlaneOnOff is examined.
     * If that bit is clear, a "plane" of zeroes will be used.
     * If the bit is set, ones will go out instead.  So, for our example:
     *   Gadget.PlanePick = $02;
     *   Gadget.PlaneOnOff = $01;
     * Note that this also allows for generic Gadgets, like the
     * System Gadgets, which will work in any number of bit planes.
     * Note also that if you want an Image that is only a filled
     * rectangle, you can get this by setting PlanePick to zero
     * (pick no planes of data) and set PlaneOnOff to describe the pen
     * color of the rectangle.

{ New for V39, Intuition supports the IESUBCLASS_NEWTABLET subclass
 * of the IECLASS_NEWPOINTERPOS event.  The ie_EventAddress of such
 * an event points to a TabletData structure (see below).
 *
 * The TabletData structure contains certain elements including a taglist.
 * The taglist can be used for special tablet parameters.  A tablet driver
 * should include only those tag-items the tablet supports.  An application
 * can listen for any tag-items that interest it.  Note: an application
 * must set the WA_TabletMessages attribute to TRUE to receive this
 * extended information in its IntuiMessages.
 *
 * The definitions given here MUST be followed.  Pay careful attention
 * to normalization and the interpretation of signs.
 *
 * TABLETA_TabletZ:  the current value of the tablet in the Z direction.
 * This unsigned value should typically be in the natural units of the
 * tablet.  You should also provide TABLETA_RangeZ.
 *
 * TABLETA_RangeZ:  the maximum value of the tablet in the Z direction.
 * Normally specified along with TABLETA_TabletZ, this allows the
 * application to scale the actual Z value across its range.
 *
 * TABLETA_AngleX:  the angle of rotation or tilt about the X-axis.  This
 * number should be normalized to fill a signed long Longint.  Positive
 * values imply a clockwise rotation about the X-axis when viewing
 * from +X towards the origin.
 *
 * TABLETA_AngleY:  the angle of rotation or tilt about the Y-axis.  This
 * number should be normalized to fill a signed long Longint.  Positive
 * values imply a clockwise rotation about the Y-axis when viewing
 * from +Y towards the origin.
 *
 * TABLETA_AngleZ:  the angle of rotation or tilt about the Z axis.  This
 * number should be normalized to fill a signed long Longint.  Positive
 * values imply a clockwise rotation about the Z-axis when viewing
 * from +Z towards the origin.
 *
 *      Note: a stylus that supports tilt should use the TABLETA_AngleX
 *      and TABLETA_AngleY attributes.  Tilting the stylus so the tip
 *      points towards increasing or decreasing X is actually a rotation
 *      around the Y-axis.  Thus, if the stylus tip points towards
 *      positive X, then that tilt is represented as a negative
 *      TABLETA_AngleY.  Likewise, if the stylus tip points towards
 *      positive Y, that tilt is represented by positive TABLETA_AngleX.
 *
 * TABLETA_Pressure:  the pressure reading of the stylus.  The pressure
 * should be normalized to fill a signed long Longint.  Typical devices
 * won't generate negative pressure, but the possibility is not precluded.
 * The pressure threshold which is considered to cause a button-click is
 * expected to be set in a Preferences program supplied by the tablet
 * vendor.  The tablet driver would send IECODE_LBUTTON-type events as
 * the pressure crossed that threshold.
 *
 * TABLETA_ButtonBits:  ti_Data is a long Longint whose bits are to
 * be interpreted at the state of the first 32 buttons of the tablet.
 *
 * TABLETA_InProximity:  ti_Data is a boolean.  For tablets that support
 * proximity, they should send the (TABLETA_InProximity,FALSE) tag item
 * when the stylus is out of proximity.  One possible use we can forsee
 * is a mouse-blanking commodity which keys off this to blank the
 * mouse.  When this tag is absent, the stylus is assumed to be
 * in proximity.
 *
 * TABLETA_ResolutionX:  ti_Data is an unsigned long Longint which
 * is the x-axis resolution in dots per inch.
 *
 * TABLETA_ResolutionY:  ti_Data is an unsigned long Longint which
 * is the y-axis resolution in dots per inch.

{ Compatibility note:
 *
 * The AA chipset supports variable sprite width and resolution, but
 * the setting of width and resolution is global for all sprites.
 * When no other sprites are in use, Intuition controls the sprite
 * width and sprite resolution for correctness based on pointerclass
 * attributes specified by the creator of the pointer.  Intuition
 * controls sprite resolution with the VTAG_DEFSPRITERESN_SET tag
 * to VideoControl().  Applications can override this on a per-viewport
 * basis with the VTAG_SPRITERESN_SET tag to VideoControl().
 *
 * If an application uses a sprite other than the pointer sprite,
 * Intuition will automatically regenerate the pointer sprite's image in
 * a compatible width.  This might involve BitMap scaling of the imagery
 * you supply.
 *
 * If any sprites other than the pointer sprite were obtained with the
 * old GetSprite() call, Intuition assumes that the owner of those
 * sprites is unaware of sprite resolution, hence Intuition will set the
 * default sprite resolution (VTAG_DEFSPRITERESN_SET) to ECS-compatible,
 * instead of as requested by the various pointerclass attributes.
 *
 * No resolution fallback occurs when applications use ExtSprites.
 * Such applications are expected to use VTAG_SPRITERESN_SET tag if
 * necessary.
 *
 * NB:  Under release V39, only sprite width compatibility is implemented.
 * Sprite resolution compatibility was added for V40.

{ Here's a brief summary of how the custom string gadget edit hook works:
 *      You provide a hook in StringInfo.Extension.EditHook.
 *      The hook is called in the standard way with the 'object'
 *      a pointer to SGWork, and the 'message' a pointer to a command
 *      block, starting either with (longword) SGH_KEY, SGH_CLICK,
 *      or something new.
 *
 *      You return 0 if you don't understand the command (SGH_KEY is
 *      required and assumed).  Return non-zero if you implement the
 *      command.
 *
 *   SGH_KEY:
 *      There are no parameters following the command longword.
 *
 *      Intuition will put its idea of proper values in the SGWork
 *      before calling you, and if you leave SGA_USE set in the
 *      SGWork.Actions field, Intuition will use the values
 *      found in SGWork fields WorkBuffer, NumChars, BufferPos,
 *      and LongInt, copying the WorkBuffer back to the StringInfo
 *      Buffer.
 *
 *      NOTE WELL: You may NOT change other SGWork fields.
 *
 *      If you clear SGA_USE, the string gadget will be unchanged.
 *
 *      If you set SGA_END, Intuition will terminate the activation
 *      of the string gadget.  If you also set SGA_REUSE, Intuition
 *      will reuse the input event after it deactivates your gadget.
 *
 *      In this case, Intuition will put the value found in SGWork.Code
 *      into the IntuiMessage.Code field of the IDCMP_GADGETUP message it
 *      sends to the application.
 *
 *      If you set SGA_BEEP, Intuition will call DisplayBeep(); use
 *      this if the user has typed in error, or buffer is full.
 *
 *      Set SGA_REDISPLAY if the changes to the gadget warrant a
 *      gadget redisplay.  Note: cursor movement requires a redisplay.
 *
 *      Starting in V37, you may set SGA_PREVACTIVE or SGA_NEXTACTIVE
 *      when you set SGA_END.  This tells Intuition that you want
 *      the next or previous gadget with GFLG_TABCYCLE to be activated.
 *
 *   SGH_CLICK:
 *      This hook command is called when Intuition wants to position
 *      the cursor in response to a mouse click in the string gadget.
 *
 *      Again, here are no parameters following the command longword.
 *
 *      This time, Intuition has already calculated the mouse position
 *      character cell and put it in SGWork.BufferPos.  The previous
 *      BufferPos value remains in the SGWork.StringInfo.BufferPos.
 *
 *      Intuition will again use the SGWork fields listed above for
 *      SGH_KEY.  One restriction is that you are NOT allowed to set
 *      SGA_END or SGA_REUSE for this command.  Intuition will not
 *      stand for a gadget which goes inactive when you click in it.
 *
 *      You should always leave the SGA_REDISPLAY flag set, since Intuition
 *      uses this processing when activating a string gadget.
