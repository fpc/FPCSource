    { If the BitMap plane pointers are non-zero, this tells the system
      that the image comes pre-drawn (if the appliprog wants to define
      it's own box, in any shape or size it wants!);  this is OK by
      Intuition as long as there's a good correspondence between

{ The Timage.PlanePick and PlaneOnOff variables work much the same way as the equivalent GELS Bob variables.  It's a space-saving
  mechanism for image data.  Rather than defining the image data for every plane of the RastPort, you need define data only
  for the planes that are not entirely zero or one.  As you define your Imagery, you will often find that most of the planes
  ARE just as color selectors.  For instance, if you're designing a two-color Gadget to use colors two and three, and the Gadget
  will reside in a five-plane display, bit plane zero of your imagery would be all ones, bit plane one would have data that
  describes the imagery, and bit planes two through four would be all zeroes.  Using these flags allows you to avoid wasting all
  that memory in this way:  first, you specify which planes you want your data to appear in using the PlanePick variable.  For
  each bit set in the variable, the next "plane" of your image data is blitted to the display.  For each bit clear in this
  variable, the corresponding bit in PlaneOnOff is examined. If that bit is clear, a "plane" of zeroes will be used.
  If the bit is set, ones will go out instead.  So, for our example:
    Gadget.PlanePick = $02;
    Gadget.PlaneOnOff = $01;
  Note that this also allows for generic Gadgets, like the System Gadgets, which will work in any number of bit planes.
  Note also that if you want an Image that is only a filled rectangle, you can get this by setting PlanePick to zero
  (pick no planes of data) and set PlaneOnOff to describe the pen color of the rectangle.}

  ie_EventAddress field points at the IENewTablet structure that the driver supplied.

  structure has an additional field for tablet data, which is usually
  nil.  If a tablet driver which is sending IESUBCLASS_NEWTABLET

{ New for V39, Intuition supports the IESUBCLASS_NEWTABLET subclass
 * of the IECLASS_NEWPOINTERPOS event.  The ie_EventAddress of such
 * an event points to a TabletData structure (see below).
 *
 * The TabletData structure contains certain elements including a taglist.
 * The taglist can be used for special tablet parameters.  A tablet driver
 * should include only those tag-items the tablet supports.  An application
 * can listen for any tag-items that interest it.  Note: an application
 * must set the WA_TabletMessages attribute to TRUE to receive this
 * extended information in its IntuiMessages.
 *
 * The definitions given here MUST be followed.  Pay careful attention
 * to normalization and the interpretation of signs.
 *
 * TABLETA_TabletZ:  the current value of the tablet in the Z direction.
 * This unsigned value should typically be in the natural units of the
 * tablet.  You should also provide TABLETA_RangeZ.
 *
 * TABLETA_RangeZ:  the maximum value of the tablet in the Z direction.
 * Normally specified along with TABLETA_TabletZ, this allows the
 * application to scale the actual Z value across its range.
 *
 * TABLETA_AngleX:  the angle of rotation or tilt about the X-axis.  This
 * number should be normalized to fill a signed long Longint.  Positive
 * values imply a clockwise rotation about the X-axis when viewing
 * from +X towards the origin.
 *
 * TABLETA_AngleY:  the angle of rotation or tilt about the Y-axis.  This
 * number should be normalized to fill a signed long Longint.  Positive
 * values imply a clockwise rotation about the Y-axis when viewing
 * from +Y towards the origin.
 *
 * TABLETA_AngleZ:  the angle of rotation or tilt about the Z axis.  This
 * number should be normalized to fill a signed long Longint.  Positive
 * values imply a clockwise rotation about the Z-axis when viewing
 * from +Z towards the origin.
 *
 *      Note: a stylus that supports tilt should use the TABLETA_AngleX
 *      and TABLETA_AngleY attributes.  Tilting the stylus so the tip
 *      points towards increasing or decreasing X is actually a rotation
 *      around the Y-axis.  Thus, if the stylus tip points towards
 *      positive X, then that tilt is represented as a negative
 *      TABLETA_AngleY.  Likewise, if the stylus tip points towards
 *      positive Y, that tilt is represented by positive TABLETA_AngleX.
 *
 * TABLETA_Pressure:  the pressure reading of the stylus.  The pressure
 * should be normalized to fill a signed long Longint.  Typical devices
 * won't generate negative pressure, but the possibility is not precluded.
 * The pressure threshold which is considered to cause a button-click is
 * expected to be set in a Preferences program supplied by the tablet
 * vendor.  The tablet driver would send IECODE_LBUTTON-type events as
 * the pressure crossed that threshold.
 *
 * TABLETA_ButtonBits:  ti_Data is a long Longint whose bits are to
 * be interpreted at the state of the first 32 buttons of the tablet.
 *
 * TABLETA_InProximity:  ti_Data is a boolean.  For tablets that support
 * proximity, they should send the (TABLETA_InProximity,FALSE) tag item
 * when the stylus is out of proximity.  One possible use we can forsee
 * is a mouse-blanking commodity which keys off this to blank the
 * mouse.  When this tag is absent, the stylus is assumed to be
 * in proximity.
 *
 * TABLETA_ResolutionX:  ti_Data is an unsigned long Longint which
 * is the x-axis resolution in dots per inch.
 *
 * TABLETA_ResolutionY:  ti_Data is an unsigned long Longint which
 * is the y-axis resolution in dots per inch.

 * The AA chipset supports variable sprite width and resolution, but
 * the setting of width and resolution is global for all sprites.
 * When no other sprites are in use, Intuition controls the sprite
 * width and sprite resolution for correctness based on pointerclass
 * attributes specified by the creator of the pointer.  Intuition
 * controls sprite resolution with the VTAG_DEFSPRITERESN_SET tag
 * to VideoControl().  Applications can override this on a per-viewport
 * basis with the VTAG_SPRITERESN_SET tag to VideoControl().
 *
 * If an application uses a sprite other than the pointer sprite,
 * Intuition will automatically regenerate the pointer sprite's image in
 * a compatible width.  This might involve BitMap scaling of the imagery
 * you supply.
 *
 * If any sprites other than the pointer sprite were obtained with the
 * old GetSprite() call, Intuition assumes that the owner of those
 * sprites is unaware of sprite resolution, hence Intuition will set the
 * default sprite resolution (VTAG_DEFSPRITERESN_SET) to ECS-compatible,
 * instead of as requested by the various pointerclass attributes.
 *
 * No resolution fallback occurs when applications use ExtSprites.
 * Such applications are expected to use VTAG_SPRITERESN_SET tag if
 * necessary.
 *
 * NB:  Under release V39, only sprite width compatibility is implemented.
 * Sprite resolution compatibility was added for V40.

  SGH_CLICK = 2; // process mouse click cursor position

{ Here's a brief summary of how the custom string gadget edit hook works:
 *      You provide a hook in StringInfo.Extension.EditHook.
 *      The hook is called in the standard way with the 'object'
 *      a pointer to SGWork, and the 'message' a pointer to a command
 *      block, starting either with (longword) SGH_KEY, SGH_CLICK,
 *      or something new.
 *
 *      You return 0 if you don't understand the command (SGH_KEY is
 *      required and assumed).  Return non-zero if you implement the
 *      command.
 *
 *   SGH_KEY:
 *      There are no parameters following the command longword.
 *
 *      Intuition will put its idea of proper values in the SGWork
 *      before calling you, and if you leave SGA_USE set in the
 *      SGWork.Actions field, Intuition will use the values
 *      found in SGWork fields WorkBuffer, NumChars, BufferPos,
 *      and LongInt, copying the WorkBuffer back to the StringInfo
 *      Buffer.
 *
 *      NOTE WELL: You may NOT change other SGWork fields.
 *
 *      If you clear SGA_USE, the string gadget will be unchanged.
 *
 *      If you set SGA_END, Intuition will terminate the activation
 *      of the string gadget.  If you also set SGA_REUSE, Intuition
 *      will reuse the input event after it deactivates your gadget.
 *
 *      In this case, Intuition will put the value found in SGWork.Code
 *      into the IntuiMessage.Code field of the IDCMP_GADGETUP message it
 *      sends to the application.
 *
 *      If you set SGA_BEEP, Intuition will call DisplayBeep(); use
 *      this if the user has typed in error, or buffer is full.
 *
 *      Set SGA_REDISPLAY if the changes to the gadget warrant a
 *      gadget redisplay.  Note: cursor movement requires a redisplay.
 *
 *      Starting in V37, you may set SGA_PREVACTIVE or SGA_NEXTACTIVE
 *      when you set SGA_END.  This tells Intuition that you want
 *      the next or previous gadget with GFLG_TABCYCLE to be activated.
 *
 *   SGH_CLICK:
 *      This hook command is called when Intuition wants to position
 *      the cursor in response to a mouse click in the string gadget.
 *
 *      Again, here are no parameters following the command longword.
 *
 *      This time, Intuition has already calculated the mouse position
 *      character cell and put it in SGWork.BufferPos.  The previous
 *      BufferPos value remains in the SGWork.StringInfo.BufferPos.
 *
 *      Intuition will again use the SGWork fields listed above for
 *      SGH_KEY.  One restriction is that you are NOT allowed to set
 *      SGA_END or SGA_REUSE for this command.  Intuition will not
 *      stand for a gadget which goes inactive when you click in it.
 *
 *      You should always leave the SGA_REDISPLAY flag set, since Intuition
 *      uses this processing when activating a string gadget.
