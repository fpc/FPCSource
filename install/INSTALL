Extra Required tools
********************

ppufiles.exe    from utils/
upx.exe         latest version, currently 1.02 (available in makego32.zip)
zip.exe         the Info-Zip release

Getting the sources
*******************************

You need to checkout the fpc module from CVS, you can use a tag to retrieve
a specific release or fixes branch:

RELEASE_1_0_0	1.00 Release
RELEASE_1_0_2	1.0.2 Release
RELEASE_1_0_4	1.0.4 Release
FIXES_1_0_0	1.0.x Fixes Branch

To checkout the main (development) branch use:

cvs -z3 co fpc

To checkout a specific version use, <tag> is one of the tags above:

cvs -z3 co -d <tag> fpc


Creating *src.zip files
***********************

Now the directory is still clean from all build files you can easily create
the *src.zip files by running the following commands:

make sourcezip
make demosrc
make docsrc
make installersrc

Some of the output files need to be renamed to be in the 8.3 format:

mv installersrc.zip instsrc.zip
mv packagessrc.zip pkgssrc.zip
mv compilersrc.zip compsrc.zip


Install libgdb.a
****************

If you want the debugger included in the IDE for some target you need to
install the libgdb.a file, the libgdb_*.zip files can be found on
ftp://ftp.freepascal.org/pub/fpc/contrib

Unzip the libgdb*.zip file in the directory packages/gdbint/libgdb/<target>.


Building for go32v2,win32
*************************

When everything is in the correct place you can build the whole release for
go32v2 and win32 with the following commands:

make go32v2zip
make win32zip


Finally you can create the installer with

make installer OS_TARGET=go32v2
(copy the install.exe to the dir were you place all the go32v2 packages
before uploading)
make installer OS_TARGET=win32
(copy the install.exe ... )

Futher you need to put the files on the ftp the same way as 0.99.14 is
stored. With a script on ftp.freepascal.org you can then make the release
.zips


Building for linux
******************

For linux the creation of the release is the easiest way, just run in the
topdir:

for debs: make deb
for rpms: make rpm
for .tar.gz: copy the makepack script from install/ to the topdir. Then run
             the script
