Possible settings for common Free Pascal Makefile:

General configurable settings:
------------------------------
OS_TARGET       The target operating system you are going to compile for
                (Note: This has autodetection for go32v2,linux,winnt)

OS_SOURCE       The source operating system you compiling under
                (Note: This has autodetection for go32v2,linux,winnt)

CPU             The target CPU that is used (currently m68k,i386)
                Default: CPU=i386

OPT             General commandline options you want to give
                Example to compile with debug info: OPT=-g

OPTDEF          Commandline defines, which also need to be passed to
                programs that don't want other options (like mkdep)

NEEDOPT         Realy needed commandline options, also used when
                RELEASE=1. Example: NEEDOPT=-Sg to allow goto

PP              compiler to use, default is ppc386
                Example to compile with version 0.99.8: PP=ppc998

AS              assembler to use to compile the loaders
                Default: AS=as

LD              linker to use
                Default: LD=ld

RELEASE         setting this to a value (for example RELEASE=1) will compile
                for a release, no ppc386.cfg is read an compile is done with
                the following settings: '-Xs -OG2p2 -n'

VERBOSE         setting this to a value (for example VERBOSE=1) will compile
                with more verbosity, this can be used in combination with
                the RELEASE option. Verbosity used: '-vwni'

SMARTLINK       setting this to YES will create smartlinked files
                Example: SMARTLINK=YES

LIBNAME         set the outputname for the library to LIBNAME, mostly used
                in combination with SMARTLINK to create a one library which
                contains all units
                Example: LIBNAME=objpas SMARTLINK=yes

LIBTYPE         can be set to shared or static to set the library type you
                want to create. When shared is set it overrides smartlink
                and turns it off.
                Example: LIBTYPE=shared LIBNAME=objpas


Location:
---------
INC             Where to find the .inc files.
                Example: INC=inc

PROCINC         Where to find processor dependent .inc files
                Example: PROCINC=$(CPU)

OSINC           Where to find operating system dependent .inc files
                Example: OSINC=$(OS_TARGET)

TARGETDIR       Where to place all the .o,.ppu,.exe files
                Example: TARGETDIR=. (this is needed when you compile
                a unit from an other dir, but want the .ppu,.o in the
                current directory)

UNITTARGETDIR   Where to place the .o,.ppu files, this overrides the
                TARGETDIR setting for these files.
                Example see TARGETDIR


File Handling:
--------------

INSTALLEXE      Command to install an executable file
MKDIR           Command to make a new directory


Tools:
------
LDCONFIG        command to rebuild the ld.so.cache (automaticly set for linux)
PPAS            ppas.sh for linux, other os's ppas.bat
