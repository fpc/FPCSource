\section*{About this guide}
This document describes all constants, types, variables, functions and
procedures as they are declared in the units that come standard with the FCL
(Free Component Library).

Throughout this document, we will refer to functions, types and variables
with \var{typewriter} font. Functions and procedures gave their own
subsections, and for each function or procedure we have the following
topics:
\begin{description}
\item [Declaration] The exact declaration of the function.
\item [Description] What does the procedure exactly do ?
\item [Errors] What errors can occur.
\item [See Also] Cross references to other related functions/commands.
\end{description}
