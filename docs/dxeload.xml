<package name="rtl">
<module name="dxeload">
<short>Load DXE file in to memory</short>
<descr>
<p>
The <file>dxeload</file> unit was implemented by Pierre Mueller for dos,
it allows to load a DXE file (an object file with 1 entry point)
into memory and return a pointer to the entry point.

<p>
It exists only for dos.

<short>Record with header of DXE file</short>
<descr>
The <var>dxe_header</var> record describes the header of a DXE file. It is used to
determine the magic number of the DXE file and number of relocations that 
must be done when the object file is loaded in memory.

<element name="dxe_load">
