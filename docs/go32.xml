<short>GO32 - acces to the 32-bit DOS extender</short>
<!-- \FPCexampledir{go32ex} -->
<descr>
<p>
This document describes the GO32 unit for the Free Pascal
compiler under dos. It was donated by Thomas Schatzl
(tom_at_work@geocities.com), for which my thanks.
This unit was first written for dos by Florian Klaempfl.
</p>
<p>
Only the GO32V2 DPMI
mode is discussed by me here due to the fact that new applications shouldn't
be created with the older GO32V1 model. The go32v2 version is much more advanced and
better. Additionally a lot of functions only work in DPMI mode anyway.
I hope the following explanations and introductions aren't too confusing at
all. If you notice an error or bug send it to the FPC mailing list or
directly to me.
So let's get started and happy and error free coding I wish you....

<topic name="DPMI">
<short>What is DPMI</short>
<descr>
The dos Protected Mode Interface helps you with various aspects of protected
mode programming. These are roughly divided into descriptor handling, access
to dos memory, management of interrupts and exceptions, calls to real mode
functions and other stuff. Additionally it automatically provides swapping
to disk for memory intensive applications.
A DPMI host (either a Windows dos box or CWSDPMI.EXE) provides these
functions for your programs.

</topic>

<topic name="SelectorsDescriptors">
<short>Selectors and descriptors</short>
<descr>
Descriptors are a bit like real mode segments; they describe (as the name
implies) a memory area in protected mode. A descriptor contains information
about segment length, its base address and the attributes of it (i.e. type,
access rights, ...).
These descriptors are stored internally in a so-called descriptor table,
which is basically an array of such descriptors.
Selectors are roughly an index into this table.
Because these 'segments' can be up to 4 GB in size, 32 bits aren't
sufficient anymore to describe a single memory location like in real mode.
48 bits are now needed to do this, a 32 bit address and a 16 bit sized
selector. The GO32 unit provides the tseginfo record to store such a
pointer.
But due to the fact that most of the time data is stored and accessed in the
%ds selector, FPC assumes that all pointers point to a memory location of
this selector. So a single pointer is still only 32 bits in size. This value
represents the offset from the data segment base address to this memory
location.
</descr>
</topic>

<topic name="FPCspecs">
<short>FPC specialities</short>
<descr>
<p>
The %ds and %es selector MUST always contain the same value or some system
routines may crash when called. The %fs selector is preloaded with the
DOSMEMSELECTOR variable at startup, and it MUST be restored after use,
because again FPC relys on this for some functions. Luckily we asm
programmers can still use the %gs selector for our own purposes, but for how
long ?

<topic name="DosMemory">
<short>dos memory access</short>
<descr>
Dos memory is accessed by the predefined <var>dosmemselector</var> selector; 
the GO32 unit additionally provides some functions to help you with standard tasks,
like copying memory from heap to dos memory and the likes. Because of this
it is strongly recommened to use them, but you are still free to use the
provided standard memory accessing functions which use 48 bit pointers. The
third, but only thought for compatibility purposes, is using the
<var>mem[]</var>-arrays. These arrays map the whole 1 Mb dos space. They shouldn't be
used within new programs.
To convert a segment:offset real mode address to a protected mode linear
address you have to multiply the segment by 16 and add its offset. This
linear address can be used in combination with the DOSMEMSELECTOR variable.

<topic name="InterruptHandling">
<short>Interrupt redirection</short>
<descr>
Interrupts are program interruption requests, which in one or another way
get to the processor; there's a distinction between software and hardware
interrupts. The former are explicitely called by an 'int' instruction and
are a bit comparable to normal functions. Hardware interrupts come from
external devices like the keyboard or mouse. Functions that handle hardware
interrupts are called handlers.
</descr>
</topic>

<topic name="DPMIInterrupts">
<short>Handling interrupts with DPMI</short>
<descr>
The interrupt functions are real-mode procedures; they normally can't be
called in protected mode without the risk of an protection fault. So the
DPMI host creates an interrupt descriptor table for the application.
Initially all software interrupts (except for int 31h, 2Fh and 21h function
4Ch) or external hardware interrupts are simply directed to a handler that
reflects the interrupt in real-mode, i.e. the DPMI host's default handlers
switch the CPU to real-mode, issue the interrupt and switch back to
protected mode. The contents of general registers and flags are passed to
the real mode handler and the modified registers and flags are returned to
the protected mode handler. Segment registers and stack pointer are not
passed between modes.
</descr>
</topic>

<topic name="DPMIvsProtectedInterrupts">
<short>Protected mode interrupts vs. Real mode interrupts</short>
<descr>
As mentioned before, there's a distinction between real mode interrupts and
protected mode interrupts; the latter are protected mode programs, while the
former must be real mode programs. To call a protected mode interrupt
handler, an assembly 'int' call must be issued, while the other is called
via the realintr() or intr() function. Consequently, a real mode interrupt
then must either reside in dos memory (&lt;1MB) or the application must
allocate a real mode callback address via the get_rm_callback() function.
</descr>

<topic name="CreatingInterruptHandlers">
<short>Creating your own interrupt handlers</short>

Interrupt redirection with FPC pascal is done via the set_pm_interrupt() for
protected mode interrupts or via the set_rm_interrupt() for real mode
interrupts.

<topic name="DisablingInterrupts">
<short>Disabling interrupts</short>
<descr>
The GO32 unit provides the two procedures disable() and enable() to disable
and enable all interrupts.
</descr>
</topic>

<topic name="HardwareInterrupts">
<short>Hardware interrupts</short>
<descr>
Hardware interrupts are generated by hardware devices when something unusual
happens; this could be a keypress or a mouse move or any other action. This
is done to minimize CPU time, else the CPU would have to check all installed
hardware for data in a big loop (this method is called 'polling') and this
would take much time.
A standard IBM-PC has two interrupt controllers, that are responsible for
these hardware interrupts: both allow up to 8 different interrupt sources
(IRQs, interrupt requests). The second controller is connected to the first
through IRQ 2 for compatibility reasons, e.g. if controller 1 gets an IRQ 2,
he hands the IRQ over to controller 2. Because of this up to 15 different
hardware interrupt sources can be handled.
IRQ 0 through IRQ 7 are mapped to interrupts 8h to Fh and the second
controller (IRQ 8 to 15) is mapped to interrupt 70h to 77h.
All of the code and data touched by these handlers MUST be locked (via the
various locking functions) to avoid page faults at interrupt time. Because
hardware interrupts are called (as in real mode) with interrupts disabled,
the handler has to enable them before it returns to normal program
execution. Additionally a hardware interrupt must send an EOI (end of
interrupt) command to the responsible controller; this is acomplished by
sending the value 20h to port 20h (for the first controller) or A0h (for the
second controller).
The following example shows how to redirect the keyboard interrupt.

<topic name="ExecutingInterrupts">
<short>Executing software interrupts</short>
<descr>
Simply execute a realintr() call with the desired interrupt number and the
supplied register data structure.
But some of these interrupts require you to supply them a pointer to a
buffer where they can store data to or obtain data from in memory. These
interrupts are real mode functions and so they only can access the first Mb
of linear address space, not FPC's data segment.
For this reason FPC supplies a pre-initialized dos memory location within
the GO32 unit. This buffer is internally used for dos functions too and so
it's contents may change when calling other procedures. It's size can be
obtained with <link id="tb_size"/> and it's linear address via 
<link id="transfer_buffer"/>.
Another way is to allocate a completely new dos memory area via the
<link id="global_dos_alloc"/> function for your use and 
supply its real mode address.

<topic name="RealModeCallBacks">
<short>Real mode callbacks</short>
<descr>
<p>
The callback mechanism can be thought of as the converse of calling a real
mode procedure (i.e. interrupt), which allows your program to pass
information to a real mode program, or obtain services from it in a manner
that's transparent to the real mode program.
In order to make a real mode callback available, you must first get the real
mode callback address of your procedure and the selector and offset of a
register data structure. This real mode callback address (this is a
segment:offset address) can be passed to a real mode program via a software
interrupt, a dos memory block or any other convenient mechanism.
When the real mode program calls the callback (via a far call), the DPMI
host saves the registers contents in the supplied register data structure,
switches into protected mode, and enters the callback routine with the
following settings:
</p>
<ul>
<li> interrupts disabled</li>
<li> <var>%CS:%EIP</var> = 48 bit pointer specified in the original call to 
<link id="get_rm_callback"/></li>
<li> <var>%DS:%ESI</var> = 48 bit pointer to to real mode <var>SS:SP</var></li>
<li> <var>%ES:%EDI</var> = 48 bit pointer of real mode register data
structure. </li>
<li> <var>%SS:%ESP</var> = locked protected mode stack</li>
<li>  All other registers undefined</li>
</ul>
<p>
The callback procedure can then extract its parameters from the real mode
register data structure and/or copy parameters from the real mode stack to
the protected mode stack. Recall that the segment register fields of the
real mode register data structure contain segment or paragraph addresses
that are not valid in protected mode. Far pointers passed in the real mode
register data structure must be translated to virtual addresses before they
can be used with a protected mode program.
The callback procedure exits by executing an IRET with the address of the
real mode register data structure in <var>%ES:%EDI</var>, passing information back to
the real mode caller by modifying the contents of the real mode register
data structure and/or manipulating the contents of the real mode stack. The
callback procedure is responsible for setting the proper address for
resumption of real mode execution into the real mode register data
structure; typically, this is accomplished by extracting the return address
from the real mode stack and placing it into the <var>%CS:%EIP</var> fields of the real
mode register data structure. After the IRET, the DPMI host switches the CPU
back into real mode, loads ALL registers with the contents of the real mode
register data structure, and finally returns control to the real mode
program.
All variables and code touched by the callback procedure MUST be locked to
prevent page faults.

This function allocates memory from dos memory pool, i.e. memory below the 1
MB boundary that is controlled by dos. Such memory blocks are typically used
to exchange data with real mode programs, TSRs, or device drivers. The
function returns both the real mode segment base address of the block and
one descriptor that can be used by protected mode applications to access the
block. This function should only used for temporary buffers to get real mode
information (e.g. interrupts that need a data structure in ES:(E)DI),
because every single block needs an unique selector. The returned selector
should only be freed by a <link id="global_dos_free"/>  call.

<element name="segment_to_descriptor">
<short>Map segment address to descriptor</short>
<descr>
<p>
Maps a real mode segment (paragraph) address onto an descriptor that can be
used by a protected mode program to access the same memory.
</p>
<p>
Parameters:
</p>
<dl>
<dt>seg</dt><dd>the real mode segment you want the descriptor to.</dd>
</dl>
<p>
Return values: Descriptor to real mode segment address.
</p>
<remark>
The returned descriptors limit will be set to 64 kB. Multiple calls
to this function with the same segment address will return the same
selector. Descriptors created by this function can never be modified or
freed. Programs which need to examine various real mode addresses using the
same selector should use the function 
<link id="allocate_ldt_descriptors"/> and change
the base address as necessary.

<element name="set_rm_interrupt">
<short>Set real mode interrupt handler</short>
<descr>
<p>
Sets a real mode interrupt handler.
