{This program tests if huge arrays work on 64-bit systems. I got the idea
 testing this because today I had a Fortran program that didn't work. After
 inspection it appeared the mad scientist was using arrays > 2GB.

 So, I did a test how well FPC handled such code. Disappointment, FPC
 did generate wrong code.

 Note that this test does not use huge amounts of memory, as the operating
 system should allocate a page on write.
 does not get allocated.}
