- text   text mode demos (should run everywhere)
- graph  demos those use the graph unit (runs nearly everywhere)
         includes gameunit (text&graph), outputs to another subdir level
- modex  demos those make extensive use of modeX (runs with go32v2 only)
- win32  demos those are win32 specific
- linux  demos those are linux specific
- os2    demos those are OS/2 specific

and rebuild the real Makefile by entering 'fpcmake'.
This is a special fpc generic utility to simplify
platform independent makefile generation for the user.
