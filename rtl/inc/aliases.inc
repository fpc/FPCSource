    This file contains external definitions (which map to aliases
    of functions which are later implemented) so that they can
    be called before their implementation is known. We can't use
    forward definitions, because there's a bug which causes all
    sorts of trouble if you you first declare a procedure as
    forward, then call it and then implement it using an
    "external name 'bla'" where 'bla' is a public alias of a
    procedure defined after the call to the forward defined
    procedure.
